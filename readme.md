# Starting My Home Lab


When I first started working on my home lab, I had no idea where to start.

I figured the most important piece of the puzzle would be getting access to the most frequently used network appliances:
* A router
* A switch
* A wireless access point

I decided to make an investment in TP-Link equipment to form this foundation. I selected the following devices:

* ER-605 v2 Router
  * This router would allow a lot of customization for things like VLANs, ACLs, VPN connectivity, and a number of other security and network management features.
* TL-SG2008P Switch
  * Similar to the router, this switch has a ton of options for customization as well as a number of PoE+ ports, which I wanted to use to power WAPs and cameras down the line
* AX 1800 WAP
  * This access point was primarily going to be used for learning to work with VLANs, captive portals, and hopefully down the line set up 802.11x features.

Here is the lab today.

I am running Proxmox on a Dell Optiplex 5060 (i5-8500T, 16gb RAM). I also had two extra 1TB hard drives that were not being used which now serve as the backup destination for 3 separate PCs here at home.
